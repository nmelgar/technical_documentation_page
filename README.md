# technical_documentation_page
This was a project created as part of my course from Freecodecamp.org, "Responsive Web Design Certification".<br>
All the code was written by me.<br>
The project was also created as image on Figma by me. https://www.figma.com/file/VUrdk2HsASHSGdCDxpPhAc/technical_documentation_page?node-id=0%3A1 <br>
Here's the codepen of the project https://codepen.io/nmelgar/pen/bGgObbO (It's not exactly as expected in the FreeCodeCamp course :)) <br>
